I did not make or claim to make the information the torrent is hashed from.
information being the bad apple video and song, I did'nt make that.
for legal reasons a torrent contains no information it mearly identifies 
information.

let's pretend 84 is a big number 
8+4 = 12 and 1+2 is 3 
but 3 is not 8 + 4 or 84 
you can't get 8+4 from 3 
but you can check that 84 is not 72
because if you keep adding the digits together 
72 eventualy gives you 9
but 84 eventualy gives you 3
because of collisions like 3+3+3+3 = 12 
a more complex method is used for actual torrents 
over simply adding the digits together
